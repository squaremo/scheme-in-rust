# Scheme in Rust

This is a Scheme interpreter, written mainly for me to get familiar
with Rust. I may use it to test out some language variations.

I started by following [this how
to](https://blog.mgattozzi.dev/scheme-input/), but that runs out
pretty quickly. To progress, I have relied on my notes and code from
[Lisp in Small
Pieces](https://github.com/squaremo/lisp-in-small-pieces), the Rust
documentation, and internet search.
